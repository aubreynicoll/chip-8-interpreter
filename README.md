# Chip-8 Interpreter

A Chip-8 interpreter written using Rust and SDL.

The Chip-8 was a virtual machine from the 1970's that supported 36 machine code operations and a 4kB flat memory model. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8)

Output was 64x32 pixels monochrome, and it was capable of producing sound at only a single pitch. Thankfully, games have come a long way since then.

I programmed this because I am interested in the topic of emulation, and would like to work on more complex systems in the future.
