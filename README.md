# Chip-8 Interpreter

A hobby project, just for getting my feet wet with emulation concepts before moving on to more interesting and challenging projects, such as Intel 8080 or GameBoy.
Overall, it's pretty bare; more of a learning project than something intended for actual users. I'm not terribly interested in playing Chip-8 games, after all.
